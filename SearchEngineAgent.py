# Building an agent that can interact with a search engine. 
# This will enable asking this agent questions, watch it call the search tool, and have conversations with it.
# Agents are systems that use LLMs as reasoning engines to determine which actions to take and the inputs necessary
# to perform the action. After executing actions, the results can be fed back into the LLM to determine whether more
# actions are needed, or whether it is okay to finish. This is often achieved via tool-calling.

# As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on 
# inside your chain or agent. The best way to do this is with LangSmith.
